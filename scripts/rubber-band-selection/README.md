## Rubber Band Selection
The rubber band selection script does exactly what the name implies, adds the ability to turn your mouse cursor into a rubber band selector. It's commonly used in RTS/Tower Defense games. But has a wide variety of uses.

## Usage
Launch demo.blend and play. Drag the mouse cursor to select objects.
