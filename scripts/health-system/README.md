## Health System
The health system is a [pretty awesome] script for dealing damage and displaying damage using a health bar! The best part, it's completely dynamic! Well, what's that mean? Basically, you can set the max health to whatever you want, and the health bar will automagically scale properly without getting any larger.

## Usage
Launch demo.blend and play. Space bar deals random amounts of damage to the object.
